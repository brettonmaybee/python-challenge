This repository contains python code for analyzing two different data sets. 
  In the PyBank folder, their is main.py. This code analyzes budget_data.csv, located in the resources folder. It then copies the analysis to analysis.txt located in the analysis folder. The code analyzes budget_data.csv and provides; the total number of months in the dataset; the net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period; the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period; and the greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
  In the PyPoll forlder their is main.py. This code analyzes election_data.csv, located in the resources folder. When complete, it will copy the analysis to analysis.txt located in the analysis folder.

  Unfortunately, this assignment has taken me much longer than I had expected. However I will continue to update this assignment until it is completed.
